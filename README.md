###### *include image*
### An original board game built from the foundational gameplay elements of Settlers of Catan: Lupa's Mound carries over many of the same rules and mechanics from the *classic* Catan while also establishing its own unique gameplay by centering around 2 player games. A smaller board, a single die, and last but not least: a replacement of the robber mechanic with combat!
