### An original board game built from the foundational gameplay elements of Settlers of Catan: Lupa's Mound carries over many of the same rules and mechanics from the *classic* Catan while also establishing its own unique gameplay by centering around 2 player games. A smaller board, and a single die create a faster pace that allows for quick, exciting matches.
## Basic Game Flow

### > Click the 'roll for turn' button to roll a die for each player, higher roll goes first
### > Click the 'begin' button to enter the eatablishing rounds of the game
### > For the first two rounds, each player takes turns placing one settlement and one road each
### > Once initial development has been completed, the real game begins!
